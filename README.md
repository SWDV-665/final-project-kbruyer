Week 8 – Final Course App Project

Final Project Information

The general purpose of this application is to act as an expansion tool for an existing application. This application adds the ability to capture technical information as it is encountered and preserve it for future use as needed. Additional features include the ability to add daily updates that can be passed down from shift to shift and removed as they are completed. The final release will connect to Casino’s AWS cloud service for purposes of storing data. At that time the search and add features will be developed to meet this criterion.
